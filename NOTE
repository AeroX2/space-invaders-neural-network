A quick note from past self

Collision detection is still not perfect (sometimes misses)

Fitness function negates score if the velocity is too low but it means you can't change direction without losing points
BUT an interesting thing happened the cannon actually started to oscilate (move back and forth) because of the above fitness function
it was still desirable to oscilate than stick to the edge and get a score of zero instead of negative!
